# X-Team 58 Rules

These rules establish how our team will assign tasks,
track progress on each task, and communicate with each other 
when a member is unable to complete a task that has been assigned to that member.

This document helps individual members understand the team's expectations,
and will hopefully lead to productive team work with fewer conflicts
and missed deadlines.

## How we will assign (and reassign) tasks
* dicsuss who is interested in which task
* try to divide work easily
* ideally each person gets one class

## How will we track progress (and follow-up) on completion of tasks
* through GitHub
* meet at the beginning of the assignment to distribute the tasks and toward the completion of project to ensure
everything is included
* meet when it's necessary to discuss about the barriers or disagreement


## How we will communicate difficulties with a task assigned to us

We will discuss difficulties in group and potential solutions to these difficulties. We will contact the instructor when needed/appropriate. Roadblocks should be voiced early so they can be addressed promptly.

## How we will back up each other to ensure that deadlines are not missed
